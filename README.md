Android game I made for fun. 

Note that the font I used can be found at http://style64.org/c64-truetype and should be added to the android/assets folder. 
(You can of course use what ever font you want. It should be a .ttf file and you need to make sure the path in ```Assets.loadAll()``` is correct)
